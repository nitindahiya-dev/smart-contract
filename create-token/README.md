# NitinCoin

A smart contract project for an ERC-20 token named **Nitin** (`NIT`), created using Solidity. This project demonstrates the deployment of an ERC-20 token with an owner-controlled minting feature and includes test cases written in Foundry.

---

## Features

- **ERC-20 Token:** Implements the ERC-20 token standard using OpenZeppelin's library.
- **Minting:** The contract owner can mint tokens to specific addresses.
- **Transfer Functionality:** Includes standard ERC-20 transfer functions.
- **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive test coverage for minting and transfer functionalities.

---

## Contract Details

- **Token Name:** `Nitin`
- **Token Symbol:** `NIT`
- **Total Supply:** Starts at `0` and increases with each mint.
- **Owner:** The contract deployer is the owner.

<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>Prerequisites</p>

1) Install Foundry: Follow the Foundry installation guide.
2) Set up an Ethereum development environment with a Sepolia RPC URL. (e.g., via Alchemy or Infura)
3) Have an Ethereum private key for deployment.
